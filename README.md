# Train Scheduler

This project was the homework for week 7 of the Columbia Engineering Coding Boot Camp.

## Goal
To create a train scheduler website using JavaScript, and persisting information using Firebase.

## Functionality
The site consists of a form with input fields where information for a new train formation is entered. That information is then stored in the Firebase database and used to populate fields in a table. If the next train will arrive within more than 24 hours, a field will be appended to that line showing the number of hours from today until departure.

## Objective
To implement Firebase in order to persist data.

## Built using:
* html - Structure
* CSS - Styling
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Firebase
